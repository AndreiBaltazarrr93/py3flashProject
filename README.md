### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Project Title : "DICER: A mix of poker and dices"

- A dice game where five dice will be used. There is a scoring system for the points and what makes this unique is the difference in scoring the points. The goal of the game is to hit the limit that you have set. If you get a score below the minus it will go to the negative number the limit of the negative number is -1000. There would also be a bit of the poker rule where it has full-house, straight-flush, two-pair, etc.
